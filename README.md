# quasi-1D Nozzle Flows
Contains quasi-one-dimensional flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle with and without shock capturing. 
In quasi_1D_without_shock.m, the finite difference expression is set up using MacCormack's explicit technique for the numerical solution 
of governing equations in non-conservation form; however, for the shock-capturing method, which is used in quasi_1D_with_shock_capturing.m, the conservation form of 
governing equations is employed. This problem is taken from chapter 7 of the textbook "Computational Fluid Dynamics: The Basics with Applications" by JD Anderson. 
I have also attached the document to make it easy to follow the formulations and codes. These codes are for educational purposes.
